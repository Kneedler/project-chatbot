# Flower Bot

This project is a flower themed bot, that is collecting and storing the users inputs. 

Build a chatbot using JavaScript, theme could be anything. This project reuired working in pair.
## The problem
We had a problem with; first of all understaning JavaScript because it's completely new to us both. One thing we struggled with was the userFormInputs, and getting it to work. 

We approched the problem using StackOverflow, Google and our brains. We understood the importance of naming the variables and values. If we had more time we would add some alternatives and steps in the order, and also style it more.
